**NewsAskAI** is an open-source project designed to scrape the latest news on a user-specified topic and generate a curated list of the most relevant articles. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enable users to ask questions about the news and receive context-rich, real-time answers. The project is powered by open-source Hugging Face embeddings, the Phi-3.5 Large Language Model, and Chroma DB for efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings.

Additionally, it features a user interface built with Textual, replicating the experience of a conversational chat.

## üöß **Work in Progress: Future Steps**  

- **Download Full Articles**: Implement functionality to download the entire article found based on the specified topic. 
  - *Note: Currently, the system only retrieves the titles and abstracts of articles.*
- **Parametrization**: Parameterize the application, allowing users to switch between different configuration settings easily.
- **Multiple Topics**: Enable ingestion of multiple topics simultaneously or allow users to explore top news across various categories (e.g., sports, technology, politics) without requiring a new ingestion process for each category.
- **Optimize the inference speed:** Improve the system's performance to ensure faster and more efficient real-time responses to user queries.
  - *Note: The current performance is too slow.*
- **Topic Modeling / Named Entity Recognition**: Add advanced features, such as a second processing stage, to label or tag articles for more efficient query filtering or to perform reranking of the embeddings.
  - *Example: Allow users to filter results by entities (e.g., ‚ÄúFilter by entity: ‚ÄòDoramas Baez‚Äô‚Äù) or specific topics.*
